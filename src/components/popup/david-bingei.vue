            David Bingei has always had a fascination about horses ever since he was a young teenager. Now fully immersed in corporate finance, he has decided to delve sideways into the world of the equine industry especially with his
            daughter now being fully committed to improving the equestrian environment in Indonesia.

            With a very well-versed repertoire and a passion in consultant management and higher education, David decided to lend his talents to ERI as he knows how much potential the equine industry has in store for Indonesia and the
            surrounding countries.
